### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Box

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Box with ref

A Box component with a ref property enables the direct reference and manipulation of the underlying DOM element, offering greater control and flexibility in modifying the box's appearance and behavior within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
        function App () {
          const myRef = useRef({});
          useEffect(() => {
            const styleObj = {
              borderWidth: 2,
              borderRadius: 4,
              borderColor: '#1A91FF',
            };
            myRef.current.setNativeProps({
              style: styleObj,
            });
          }, [myRef]);
        return (
          <Box sx={{ h: 100, w: 100, bg: '$primary100'}} ref={myRef} />
        );
      }
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code, 'function', 'App');
      },
      scope: { Box, Wrapper, useRef, useEffect },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Unstyled

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Box

For customizing the Box, you have to map styled view to Box. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/box` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Box) of the styled `Box` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/box/styled-components';

// mapping the Box to root component
const Box = Root;

// using the Box component
export default () => <Box />;
```
